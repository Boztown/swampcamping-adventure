======================

A little example project using NodeJS, Express, socket.io and Zepto.  Multiple users can collaborate to swap out a grid of pictures and text.  Overall it's pretty useless but could make way for something cool.

Features:

* select a square and copy/paste text or images into them (may only work in Chrome)
* alternatively, drag an image or text file from the desktop into a square
* all clients (browsers) connected will be updated in real-time
* text is trimmed to tweet size
* state of DOM is saved for when new users join in

Technology used:

* NodeJS
* Express
* socket.io
* Zepto
* Bootstrap
* ejs templates
